            <text>Wikipedia Summary for 'Binary tree': In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. That is, it is a k-ary tree with k = 2. A recursive definition using set theory is that a binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.From a graph theory perspective, binary trees as defined here are arborescences.

            <text>Wikipedia Summary for '2&#8211;3 tree': In computer science, a 2&#8211;3 tree is a tree data structure, where every node with children (internal node) has either two children (2-node) and one data element or three children (3-nodes) and two data elements. A 2&#8211;3 tree is a B-tree of order 3. Nodes on the outside of the tree (leaf nodes) have no children and one or two data elements. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2&#8211;3_tree
